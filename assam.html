The Majuli islands are spread over an area of around 452 sq km and most of these get submerged underwater during the monsoons, leaving the bigger islands like Kamalabari, Auniati, and Garamur on the surface. This is why it’s best to visit this place in Guwahati in May. This is undoubtedly among the best places to visit in Assam.
